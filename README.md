# Political_Map
This project is an attempt to create a map of the United States Districts on a web page where people could see and interact with it.

Each District would hold info on how much money different canidates in the selected district had recieved in donations to their campaign.
This would provide voters a free visually interactive platform to see who was funding their canidates.


Edit:
The website worked well but the project stalled out when I did not recieve responses from any candiates reguarding my inquieres.
